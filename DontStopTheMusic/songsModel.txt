Take off my shirt. Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt, Stare at myself in the mirror Take me apart piece by piece, Sorrow decrease Pressure release, I put in work Did more than called upon, More than deserved When it was over, Did I wind up hurt (Yes)? But it taught me before a decision ask this question first [Chorus:] Who am I living for? Is this my limit? Can I endure some more? Chances are given, Question Existing Who am I living for? Is this my limit? Can I endure some more? Chances are given, Question Existing Take off my coat, show them that under here, I'm just like you do the mistakes, I may make me a fool or a human with flaws, admit that I'm loss Round of applause, Take the abuse Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose It's entertainment is that an excuse? (No) But the question that lingers whether "win or lose" [Chorus] Dear Diary, It's Robyn Entertaining is something I do for a living It's not who I am, I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal, I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think Guys suck sometimes, But when you're in the spotlight, Everything seems good, Sometimes I feel like i have it worst cause I have to always keep my guard up, I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am, Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am, [Chorus]
